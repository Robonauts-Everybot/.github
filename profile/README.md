# The Robonaut's Everybot

The mission of Everybot is to provide a comprehensive set of build resources to field a competitive and affordable robot intended to play the FIRST Robotics Competition and FIRST Tech Challenge games; specifically targeted towards under-resourced and under-mentored teams. A successful Everybot will inspire individual students, teams, and mentors while promoting team sustainability.

Here you can find some of Everybot code, the rest can be found on our [Gitlab](https://gitlab.com/robonautseverybot). We also house our documentation site here.
